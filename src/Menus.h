// Which of the two menus that own a wheel is open: the inventory (the Equipment wheel) or the magic menu (the
// Magic wheel) - the owner, 2026-09-29: "the wheel that pops up in the magic menu is the magic wheel and the
// inventory wheel in the inventory".
//
// Both are CommonUI activatable widgets (read in game 2026-09-29): WBP_OriginalMenu_Inventory_C (native
// VInventoryMenu) and WBP_ModernMenu_MagicMenu_C (native VLegacyMagicMenu); BP_OnActivated / BP_OnDeactivated pass
// through ProcessEvent, watched with pe::Watch. Their classes load the first time each menu opens, so the watch
// lands then; the menu being opened at that moment is taken as active. The Gamebryo menu mode (1 = gameplay)
// clears the state if a deactivation was missed.
